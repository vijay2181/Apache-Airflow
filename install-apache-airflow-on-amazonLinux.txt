Open a web browser on your local machine.
Enter the public IP address or DNS name of your Amazon Linux 2 instance, followed by :8080. 
For example, if your instance's public IP address is 123.456.789.0, you would enter http://123.456.789.0:8080 in the browser's address bar.
You should see the Airflow web interface, where you can log in using the credentials you specified during the script execution. 
In the example script, the admin user's credentials are set as admin/admin.
After logging in, you can manage and monitor your Apache Airflow tasks, workflows, and configurations through the web interface.
Please ensure that port 8080 is open in your instance's security group or network ACL to allow inbound access to the Airflow web server. If you encounter any issues accessing the web interface, make sure to check your instance's security group settings.
